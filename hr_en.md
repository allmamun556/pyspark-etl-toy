---

# ✅ **3. “Describe a challenge you faced with time-series or sensor data.” — Custom Answer**

**Answer:**
“One significant challenge I faced was dealing with highly noisy and inconsistent SCADA sensor data from wind turbines at ENERTRAG. The raw signals contained missing values, sudden spikes, and non-physical measurement jumps that made the forecasting models unstable.

To solve this, I implemented a multi-step data cleaning and preprocessing pipeline:

* I used outlier detection methods like DBSCAN and IQR to remove non-physical spikes.
* I applied smoothing filters and rolling-window statistics to stabilize the signal.
* I used statistical imputation for missing segments and built quality flags for problematic periods.
* I also collaborated closely with turbine engineers to understand which signal behaviors were real and which were sensor artifacts.

Once this pipeline was in place, the forecasting model’s RMSE improved by about 15%, and the anomaly detection system produced far fewer false positives.

This experience taught me how crucial domain understanding and robust preprocessing are when working with real sensor data—lessons that I know are highly relevant for KONUX’s vibration and IIoT datasets.”

---

# ✅ **2. “Tell me about a time you failed / had conflict in a team.” — Honest but Safe Answer**

**Answer (Failure version):**
“At the beginning of my work on anomaly detection at John Deere, I built a model that flagged too many false positives. I was focused on the statistical behavior of the signals, but I had not yet involved the domain experts enough. The result was a technically correct model that wasn’t useful operationally.

I recognized this and organized a short workshop with agronomists and sensor engineers to better understand the data’s physical meaning. With their input, I adjusted the preprocessing, added more relevant features, and reduced false positives significantly.

This taught me that early collaboration with domain experts is crucial, especially when dealing with complex sensor data. Now I always bring stakeholders in early to align on expectations and assumptions.”

---

**Answer (Conflict version):**
“In one project, a colleague and I had different opinions about how to structure an ETL pipeline. He preferred a more manual script-based approach, while I wanted to use a modular design for long-term maintainability.

Instead of debating endlessly, I proposed that we build quick prototypes of both versions and evaluate them with the data engineering team. This shifted the discussion from personal preference to what delivers the best value.

In the end, we merged the best ideas from both approaches, and the collaboration improved significantly. I learned that focusing on shared goals and objective evaluation helps resolve conflicts quickly and constructively.”
